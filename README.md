# Count Lines In Project

You have coded your project for so long and now you want to see how many lines you have coded? Lazy to count by yourself? Just download this code, build, run and type your folder's name to project (folder that include source file).

The source is using for count lines in .cpp and .h files. If you want to count other files like .cs, .java,... then edit line 49 to
```
if (extension != "<file type 1 you want to count" && extension != "<file type 2" && ... && extension != "file type n") continue;
```
Sorry for my bad English~
